    "description": "This project implements Pure Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in TLS 1.3 by integrating PQC primitives for key exchange and authentication. A custom test environment using NGINX and OpenSSL with PQC support is set up, where Root CA and server certificates use ML-DSA signatures and key exchange happens via ML-KEM. Real-world network conditions are simulated to benchmark PQC TLS performance, evaluating metrics like handshake time, certificate size, key exchange size, and round-trip time, offering insights into PQC’s viability for secure communication.",
