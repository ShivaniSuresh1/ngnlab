    "description": "The proposed cardiotoxicity risk prediction system offers a comprehensive and intelligent solution for early detection of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing treatment. By integrating multi-modal data including 12-lead ECG signals, troponin biomarkers, and patient metadata within a deep learning framework enhanced by contrastive and self-supervised learning, the system provides accurate, real-time, and interpretable predictions of conditions like arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. This approach addresses the limitations of conventional diagnostic methods, supports continuous monitoring, and enhances clinical decision-making, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and safety.",
