    "description": "DisasterNet is an autonomous UAV-based disaster response system that restores communication in disconnected zones by enabling survivors to send SOS messages via WiFi, transmitting structured and prioritized alerts to rescue teams using long-range LoRa communication. It integrates AI-powered multi-modal severity detection using both text and image analysis, along with adaptive fuzzy path planning to ensure efficient, intelligent, and real-time emergency response. The system is designed for rapid deployment, operates independently of existing infrastructure, and enhances situational awareness for better decision-making during critical rescue missions.",
